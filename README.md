# landing-page
This is a dummy landing page based on an assignment from The Odin Project.  

The purpose of this assignment is to put into practice the web dev fundamentals we have studied so far.  These fundamentals include working from the command line on Linux, setting up HTML and CSS pages and linking them to each other, organizing elements within these files, and speeding up the styling process with Flexbox and the Google element inspector.
